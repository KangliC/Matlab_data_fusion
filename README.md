IMU data analysis and data fusion

File motion1 and static1 content data from real gyro sensor(mpu9150). User should load one of them before applying any analysis function.

Apply cof_betaTest(sensorData, 0.001, 0, 0.5, 'alg_name') function to start the analysis, alg_name is the name of the algorithm you want.
